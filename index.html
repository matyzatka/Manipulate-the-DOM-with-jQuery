        <p>It can be hard to go back to work after a weekend with family and friends, sleeping late and doing whatever
            we want. But Mondays don’t have to feel that way. The beginning of the week can be like the beginning of the
            year: it’s a fresh start, a blank page, an invitation to learn, create, and get things done. Here’s what you
            can do to enjoy Mondays a bit more.</p>

        <h4>Scientists consider it less likely to rain on Mondays than on any other day of the week.</h4>
        <p>The science behind it isn’t completely clear yet, though. The main working theory today is that Mondays carry
            less pollution over the weekend. This means less dust in the air, which can actually influence rainfall.</p>
